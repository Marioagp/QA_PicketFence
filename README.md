## QA_StripTest
Due to the importance of this equipment in the efficacy of cancer treatments, 
it is necessary to control each of the accelerator's operating parameters. 
One of the calibration and quality control procedures designed by the Radiophysics 
and Radiation Protection Service is the **"Strip Test" (Var√≠an TrueBeam STx)**. 
The result of its performance is a series of images showing an intentional 
error in the field irradiation. This error is currently determined by manual 
methods and there is a need to automate this process by means of digital processing 
of the images obtained. The processing of these images also provides the tools for the
extraction of statistics and analysis of data from previous tests.

The **main objective** of this [Fiji Macro](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/macros.html) is the automation of the process
and adds an extra value to the results of the **"Strip Test"**.
